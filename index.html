								<h3>Github Development Report</h3>
									In our group, Alex had the main responsibility in creating our github repository, github website and website design. 
									Using github created a collaborative repository called ‘groupwithfivepeople’. 
									Invites were sent to member’s emails to ensure that they had editing and commit privileges on the project. 
									Furthermore, a github page was used using the ‘pages’ section in settings in the github repository in order to host our code to present our website. 
									The website was created using a HTML5up template and was modified within Visual Studio Code. 
									The main layout was kept intact, however we added our own titles and text. Furthermore, we added our own images related to our subheadings. 
									Lastly, we added a ‘meet the team’ section that provides a link to every member’s github profile. 
									Members were able to access and edit the github repository by inputting their own text and images and commits were then approved by Alex.

								<h3>Cyber Security</h3>
								<h4>What does it do?</h4>
								<p>Cyber Security is a field of Information Technology (IT) that deals with the protection of “computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide” (Daniel Schatz, Rabih Bashroush, Julie Wall Towards a More Representative Definition of Cyber Security).</p>
								<p>The field of cybersecurity is broad and consists of both physical and digital forms of protection. While generally, people think cybersecurity is about fixing the holes within a program/software to mitigate vulnerabilities. It also deals with people as well. Computers and software are just tools for people to use. Thus educating the end-user is also an important area of cybersecurity. 
									Professionals often need to balance the needs of the company as well as the needs of the employees when working. Often or not the employee work culture tends to disregard the needs of information security culture due to the upper management. People are the most unpredictable factor in cybersecurity. Anyone can introduce an invasive virus to the system due to not being educated in security matters.
									</p>
								<p>When dealing with digital forms security, generally speaking, practitioners would aim to build software or programs that limit the number of ways a digital criminal can use to gain access to the users’ details. This is the domain of Application Security. Which is the (VMware) “process of developing, adding, and testing security features within applications to prevent security vulnerabilities against threats such as unauthorized access and modification”. An example of this type of security would be DevOps practices which now also include security in its processes turning into DevSecOps.</p>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a constantly growing field. As long as technology keeps on improving and as long as there are people on Earth that want to exploit others. The field is just going to keep growing. It’s likened by many practitioners as an arms race. Threats are ever-increasing and ever-changing. That is why government regulatory bodies such as the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC - Subsidiary of the Australian Signals Directorate ASD), and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), exist and play an important role in shaping the future of the field.</p>
								<p>An upcoming cybersecurity trend for 2021 would be the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) with 5G networks. Expecting to roll out in 2020 on a global scale this type of architecture is effectively still new within the industries and by extension, brings in a new playing field for both attackers and defenders. This brings in a host of cyber-security related issues as well as political intrigue. The most well-known offender would be the case with Huawei and the United States of America. While the ban on Huawei means that products and services provided by the company are unavailable it simply means that there are other contenders on the field to take advantage of this new era of 5G.</p>
								<p>On the topic of government bodies, national security also features cybersecurity heavily as it is also another way for countries to usurp and undermine others. One pillar of the Australian Government’s ‘Cyber Security Strategy’ (2016) advocates for stronger cyber defences in light of this. This sort of policy helps with the Australian Government’s ability to conduct Cyber War and warfare. Cybersecurity in this case is pretty much used for the purpose of military and espionage of foreign entities and also domestic surveillance. Following the principle of “know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles'' from Sun Tzu’s Art of War.</p>
								<p>In this same spectrum, the quote, “Data is the Currency of the Digital Age” by Jim Barbaresso (leader of Intelligent Transportation Systems at HTNB), further reinforces this notion. Not only from a militaristic mindset but also from a general security mindset.</p>
								<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
								<p>As mentioned prior cyber threats are ever-evolving and will continue to do so. Technologies will improve and new future cybersecurity professions will emerge in light of this, such as Deepfake Analyst, Driverless-Car Security Specialist, Implanted-Device Guardian, Anti-Cheat Referee, and Chief Identity and Digital Officer.</p>
								<p>Cybersecurity jobs are going to grow exponentially. With an estimated growth of 37% from 2012-2022 according to Monster.com. Despite this growth, there is still a huge shortage of qualified workers. Robert Herjavec, founder and CEO of the Herjavec Group, mentioned that “the pipeline of security talent isn’t where it needs to be to help curb the cybercrime epidemic” and thus “we will continue to be outpaced by the Black Hats.” (CyberSecurityVentures.com)</p>
								<p>Trends in the field would also change to accommodate emerging technologies. Such as Automotive Security in light of self-driving cars and the aforementioned IoT for 5G networks. Changes within the future of technology may promote an increase in security-focused processes within companies and development cycles. Because Cloud technology is being more and more used, the need for more cloud security will be necessary to prevent and mitigate any damages caused by criminal actors.</p>
								<p>That being said, from a business-orientated perspective, it means more services/products would emerge as well and changes in education on the field would change to accommodate these new trends. Gartner, Inc estimated that the market for cybersecurity would grow to “$170.4 billion in 2020”. With the biggest spenders being the government bodies and large corporations.</p>
								<p>While other tech sectors are growing by weeding out and reducing inefficiencies to increase productivity. The cyber-security field solely being driven by cybercrime. This means that the growth of the sector is linked to the growth of cybercrime. Current estimations of cybercrime damages total around $6 trillion USD and are expected to “grow by 15 per cent per year over the next five years reaching $10.5 trillion USD per annum by 2025” (CyberSecurity Ventures).</p>
								<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
								<p>With the recent media showings of data breaches, big tech companies holding a monopoly on users personal data, and privacy issues many people are becoming more and more aware of their digital safety. An example of this would be the emergence of VPN service providers which became more and more prominent as the media reveal data breaches and privacy issues. This problem also links to the emergence of more browsers that emphasises user data protection. Browsers that are not from big tech companies like Google and Microsoft are becoming more recommended and used by people concerned for their data wanting to break away from Google. Using browsers such as Firefox, DuckDuckGo, Brave etc.</p>
								<p>Knowing these types of issues, people would change their internet habits to be more cautious than before. Employing tools such as VPNs and using different browsers to protect themselves, not using public wi-fi, using multi factor authentication, boycotting certain apps/service providers etc. One main thing would also be to not use the same password throughout all your accounts and to not use an easy to crack password like QWERTY or 123456.</p>
								<p>As users, naturally, we would be exposed to a number of different products and services that all say they provide the best online protection. The case with the VPN access would include an extra bill towards the users to protect their online wellbeing. Thus the need to be more educated in matters such as these are necessary. </p>
								<p>On the side of education, with the emerging technologies, we would need to learn more ways and technologies that would be implemented in the field and keep up to date with matters like these during the course of our careers within this field or whichever career field we chose. This means to subscribe to newsletters, podcasts, industry reports, relevant media etc.</p>
								
								<h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
								<h4>What does it do?</h4>
								<p>Blockchain technology is a type of database that utilises lists of records called ‘blocks’ that are linked with each other using cryptography. The major difference between this method and traditional database methods is the way information is stored. When new data is given it is entered into a new block. Which then becomes chained onto the previous block, creating a chronological order of blocks with each containing a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp of its implementation and transactional data. To change data located within the block users would need to make alterations to all the blocks at the same time. This is by design, to prevent tampering and exploitation.</p>
								<p>Another key feature of blockchain is that it is decentralised. This means that data is stored on the peer-to-peer network eliminates a number of security risks that would occur on a centralized platform. As these peer-to-peer blockchain networks have no centralized points of vulnerability it also does not have a centralized failure point to exploit. Data stored here is considered to be incorruptible due to this combined with the blockchain design.</p>
								<p>Blockchain technology is used in a variety of industries and mediums, such as in healthcare. Providers can utilise this technology to safely secure patient details which cannot be changed once it is written into the blockchain. These health records are encrypted and can only be accessed by certain individuals, ensuring privacy. The most well-known use of blockchain technology is with crypto-currency. Primarily used as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies. In fact, the first actualization of blockchain technology was done by the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
								<p>On the topic of Bitcoin, it is a form of cryptocurrency. The very first cryptocurrency that can be compared to the gold standard for fiat currency. There are many different types of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or DogeCoin. These are known as altcoins as they were created after Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies follow the design intent of Bitcoin. To provide a system in which two parties can send payments directly to each other without going through a financial institution.</p>
								<p>According to Jan Lansky (Possible State Approaches to Cryptocurrencies) a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.</li>
									<li>The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.</li>
									<li>The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.</li>
									<li>Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.</li>
									<li>The system allows for transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.</li>
									<li>If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Following the idea of decentralization discussed prior. The concept of cryptocurrencies aims to reject the power that banks have other financial matters between two parties. A system that does electronic transactions without relying on trust. To remove the user from the central banks and by extension governments. The ideological reasoning behind the creation of Bitcoin has influenced subsequent altcoins. Pushing for economic isolation from the middlemen.</p>
								<p>While currently unsure of whether these cryptocurrencies are able to change the way money is handled in the future. They prove to be a valuable asset class for traders. With some even becoming the so-called “Bitcoin Millionaires” from selling crypto when the prices went up. However, one thing to take note of is that cryptocurrencies are not recognised as legal tender by the government because they are not issued by them.</p>
								<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
								<p>Cryptocurrencies and blockchain present a whole new field to play for many industries. While the most well-known use of blockchain technology is used as a distributed ledger for decentralized cryptocurrency. It does make for an interesting way of implementing a form of security by design of the blockchain.</p>
								<p>On the hand of cryptocurrency it is hard to say whether or not it will replace our current monetary system of fiat currency. As, firstly, these coins are not authorized or issued by any governing and legal body. Secondly it supposingly goes against the spirit behind the creation of Bitcoin. Being a medium of exchange that does not require a third party institute to handle.
									Cryptocurrency currently serves as another form of asset that is traded between parties, often in exchange for fiat currency. Looking at the economy and forecasted changes to it, assumingly cryptocurrency may play a big role in the next few years or doing a bubble/market crash.
									</p>
								<p>The advert of cryptocurrency has also influenced banks to create a form of digital currency known as “Central bank digital currency”. While directly inspired from Bitcoin, this form of currency is different in that it is issued by the state and given status as legal tender, giving it legal authority. These digital currencies most likely would not run off blockchain but on the centralized database of the banks.</p>
								<p>Public opinion plays a massive role in shaping the outcome of cryptocurrencies. While the media has shared stories of people who seemingly became “overnight millionaires”, they are from trading cryptocurrency for fiat money. Completely disregarding the purpose behind using cryptocurrency as an alternative means of purchasing power. Although this is without logic. The current banking system has been rooted deep into society. Cryptocurrencies is still a relatively new concept compared to the tested current financial system.</p>
								<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
								<p>It’s current effect on daily life is honestly minimal. This is due to the fact that cryptocurrency itself is still a pretty niche and lacks the authority of being government issued legal tender. Most if not all companies pay their employees in the form of fiat currency such as the Australia dollar. Most companies also only accept legal tender as well.</p>
								<p>In its current state it feels more akin to precious metals rather than traditional currency. So in most cases people would hold it and wait for the value to go up and then trade it in for fiat currency. Trading cryptocurrency is the trend nowadays. Especially in the advert of COVID-19 affecting the world’s economy. People are looking into alternative means to secure their finances. However cryptocurrency in the whole picture of IT technology is still relatively new in the effect it has on society. As it becomes more and more mainstream, we will start to see its impact on society more.</p>
								<p>Blockchain technology on the other hand presents a whole new avenue that can be used in many industries. It is already used in supply chain management, and financial services in the form of private blockchains. Even a video game “CryptoKitties” (2017) has been launched on the platform to demonstrate its use in cataloging game assets.</p>
								<p>In this regard it would also be safe to assume that it would be quite similar to cloud technology in the way companies start implementing it into their enterprise systems. The Linux Foundation’s blockchain initiative, Hyperledger Grid, develops open components for blockchain supply chain solutions. Knowing this, the impact blockchain technology has on many industries, it would be wise to assume that we would need to know how to operate blockchain in the future. As it becomes more developed and possibly implemented into more day to day activities within companies.</p>

								<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
								<h4>What does it do?</h4>
								<p>Autonomous Vehicles are essentially vehicles that are able to move with little to no input from a human element. Most of the knowledge that people have about autonomous vehicles stems from the popular brand Tesla. While other vehicle manufacturer brands do have their own concept or working prototype setup, Tesla is seemingly the market leader in this technology sector. Mostly limited to cars however, there haven’t been any news of heavy duty vehicles or aerospace vehicles possessing this sort of automation yet.</p>
								<p>While Tesla may have popularized the concept of a self-driving car, the very first execution of this idea came from General Motors’ 1939 exhibit by Norman Bel Geddes. This was a concept electric car that was guided by radio-controlled electro-magnetic fields generated with magnetized metal spikes embedded within the railway. This was made reality by 1958.</p>
								<p>In 1977 the Japanese made an improvement to GM’s idea by using a camera system to relay data to a computer to process images of the road. However, there was one major limitation this vehicle had. It can only travel at speeds below 20 mph. In retrospect while the speed limitation made this vehicle a commercial failure, it was a technical success as we can see inspiration from later iterations of self-driving cars using cameras and sensors to gather data from the environment for the car to use. Such as the later VaMoRs from the Germans in 1987, which had the capability to drive safely at 56 mph.</p>
								<p>Self-driving cars rely on their AI system to accomplish its task. Requiring a complex network of sensors and cameras to transfer data to the system. However this system is still plagued with challenges. While obvious technical issues may arise from the AI being unable to function properly in the chaotic inner-city environments, to the sensing and navigation systems being susceptible from the weather. The human factor also plays a big role in the implementation of self-driving cars.</p>
								<p>This idea is niche but the most mainstream it becomes, the more we have to consider ethical problems. Self-driving cars already have issues when determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals. These complex models of behavior need to be programming into the driving algorithm to disregard that issue. Driving is a human-to-human interaction, it will be hard for human drivers to identify the intention of the self-driving car when they are used to determining human actions. Another issue would be ignorance of the technology’s full capabilities. One example would be the viral videos showcasing people using Tesla's autopilot feature while sleeping, eating, watching movies or any other action that normally should not be done. This type of behaviour is reckless and was due to the ignorant belief of the infallibility of the system despite the company advising not to do so as the car is not capable of being completely autonomous.</p>
								<p>Autonomous vehicles are classified within six levels by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) International. Ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Level 0: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.</li>
									<li>Level 1 Hands On: The driver and automated system share control of the vehicle.</li>
									<li>Level 2 Hands Off: The automated system takes full control of the vehicle; accelerating, braking, and steering. The driver must monitor and intervene when necessary.</li>
									<li>Level 3 Eyes Off: The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, the vehicle can handle situations that require immediate responses such as emergency braking. However the driver is still required to be prepared to take over when necessary.</li>
									<li>Level 4 Mind Off: No driver attention is required for safety. However at this level self-driving is limited to certain areas or special circumstances.</li>
									<li>Level 5 Steering Wheel Optional: No human element needed at all.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Currently most self-driving cars in the market operate on or under level 2 SAE level. Perhaps within the next few years or longer, self-driving cars in the market would reach a higher SAE level.</p>
								<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
								<p>Self-driving vehicles present a new avenue for many industries that are either reliant on or make use of vehicles. Such as the trucking industry and the delivery industry. While many may know of the Tesla self-driving car as a driving force of futurization in our personal vehicles, other companies are using this technology to build new services for profit.</p>
								<p>One such example of this would be Waymo who has highlighted four specific uses for their autonomous technology: Ride sharing, users can hail cars equipped with Waymo technology through transportation network company applications; trucking and logistics, urban last-mile solutions for public transport, and passenger cars.</p>
								<p>However some concerns have arisen from the idea that self-driving vehicles will make driving jobs redundant. If cars, trucks and buses are able to drive themselves without needing someone to take over for emergencies then possibly companies would not find the need to hire drivers. Leading to unemployment within industries like the trucking, delivery and taxi industries.</p>
								<p>Another impact would sprout from the cyber-security industry. This technology has already presented a new way for black hats to use. Self-driving cars are completely dependent on their in-built computers and software systems to operate. They can be fully controlled if a hacker manages to get access to the systems, potentially turning it into a weapon. Furthermore in the future, driverless cars may likely be networked with each other so they can communicate and send and receive data with each other. An attack on this network could be very damaging and could result in loss of human lives.</p>
								<p>One other issue to take note of would be how laws are implemented in regards to autonomous vehicles. Moral issues will arise and who will be liable for the vehicle in question when something bad occurs? Laws regarding motor vehicles will need to be able to fully handle all the potential issues that may arise from driverless cars and the interactions between humans.</p>
								<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
								<p>The effect of self-driving cars on us currently is pretty much minimal in Melbourne, Australia. The self-driving feature in cars are typically only featured in brands like Tesla which cost quite a lot in Australia. While people do drive those cars out in the streets, using auto-pilot they probably don’t in most cases. The only times that people would let the system take control would be using cruise control during high speeds and such.</p>
								<p>In all honesty the current thoughts of the self driving feature is purely novelty at best. It would take time and technology advancements before hands off driving becomes mainstream. Right now it does not seem apparent that many people are opting to use that feature over manual driving. Furthermore most affordable vehicles from other brands do not possess the same capacity of self-driving that Tesla models have.</p>
								<p>That being said, job opportunities for us are already impacted in a positive way. The automotive and tech industries are investing heavily into this technology. This would pave the way for multiple jobs and roles, or even startups that research into improving current technology to make self-driving cars hit a higher SAE level. One example of a startup in this industry would be the most recent ‘youngest billionaire’ in the media who is the CEO and founder of Luminar Technologies, Austin Russell <https://www.luminartech.com>. This company focuses on researching and developing car sensors for self-propelling cars. Working with famous brands such as Volvo, to implement their sensing technology into their cars.</p>
								<p>As IT students we would need to keep updated on occurrences that happen within this industry. It is forecasted to be growing more and more and, depending on interests, students may learn about what goes on and possibly leverage their knowledge into a startup or with a company to create monumental improvements into the automotive industry.</p>

								<h3>Clouds, servicess, servers</h3>
								<h4>What does it do?</h4>
								<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, and intelligences over the internet. Companies like Microsoft (Azure), Amazon (AWS), IBM (IBM Cloud), Alibaba (Alibaba Cloud), and Google (Google Cloud Platform) are the major dominant players in cloud computing. With Amazon reportedly popularizing this technology with their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) product in 2006.</p>
								<p>The main purpose of cloud computing is to allow users to benefit from a wide range of technologies requiring specialized knowledge or expertise with each one. Aiming to theoretically cut costs from IT infrastructure and allow users to focus on their core business without being impeded by IT challenges. Due to the main enabling technology for cloud computing, virtualization. This is the act of creating a virtual version of something. In relation to cloud computing we would have virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. Thus companies which operate on the cloud do not need to invest a lot into hardware for their uses.</p>
								<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined cloud computing to be composed of “five essential characteristics”: On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. The NIST has also created standardized Cloud computing services models. Which are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>
								<p>Cloud computing also typically comes in three distinct forms; public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud. Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers who deliver their computing resources to customers over the internet. For example, in data storage users can store their documents and files using Google Drive which is situated on Google’s Cloud Platform. Private clouds are intended for use by a single organization and can be either managed and hosted internally or by a third party. Similar to public cloud infrastructure with the only difference being the intended user. Hybrid cloud has the elements of both public and private clouds by combining them both together to allow data and applications to be shared between each other.</p>
								<p>Advantages of using cloud-base software in enterprises offers companies from all sectors a number of benefits, including the ability for their staff members to use software from any device either by app or browser. Offering huge potential savings to IT infrastructure. The cloud structure would also allow users to update/upgrade their software more faster due to the software companies being able to offer their products through the web rather than through traditional methods like through disks and flash drives. An example of this would be the Adobe Creative Cloud which allows customers to have access to all of Adobe’s applications via subscription. Allowing consumers to download new versions and also patches to their programs easily.</p>
								<p>Of course with the advent of Cloud computing becoming more and more popular with companies, cloud security is becoming more necessary to implement as well. This is one of the disadvantages of cloud computing. Security issues that may arise from using cloud technology falls within two broad categories: issues faced by providers and issues faced by consumers. Whilst the responsibility is shared between the two parties, the providers need to make sure that their infrastructure is safe and secure, and their client’s data and applications are protected. On the user side, they need to make sure that measures are taken to ensure policies are in place to secure strong authentication.</p>
								<p>Cloud security architectures are typically split into four camps of control; deterrent, preventive, detective and corrective. These are implemented to safeguard any weaknesses and vulnerabilities within the system to mitigate the damage of any potential attacks.</p>
								<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
								<p>Cloud technologies are widely used in many industries and sectors. One prominent example would be due to the COVID pandemic affecting many businesses, forcing remote work to be the norm. Many companies that were not using cloud technology, started to migrate to using it. On the other end of the spectrum there have also been companies that form which provide cloud solutions to businesses that want to make the transfer. By leveraging their expertise with cloud technology to provide custom made solutions for clients. In business settings cloud has also been useful as a data backup centre for emergencies should a company be victim to cyber attacks that compromise their systems.</p>
								<p>This effect spreads towards educational systems as well. With E-learning becoming more and more popular as people are quarantined. Cloud computing can easily connect students from different locations with a distribution of resources including computers, databases and storage devices.</p>
								<p>The game industry has an interesting application of cloud technology called cloud gaming. Which allows video games to run on remote servers and streams them directly to the user’s device. Contrasting traditional gaming which runs locally from the user’s console, personal computer, or mobile device. This has been pretty hyped up within the video game industry when it was announced with Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming (launched September 15 2020) receiving positive reviews from players during it’s beta launch. This is a huge impact in the video game industry that cloud technology has. Multiple major tech players have launched their own cloud gaming platforms. With Amazon’s Project Luna, Google’s Stadia, and Nvidia’s Geforce Now to name a few.</p>
								<p>If cloud gaming becomes mainstream we would not see a need for upgrading PC parts as the cloud system would take over the computation. While the users just need a fantastic internet infrastructure to enjoy the 4k gaming experience.</p>
								<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
								<p>Whether we know it or not, some parts of our lives have already been affected by the usage of cloud technology. Netflix is a huge streaming service that uses cloud technology to give their customers fabulous HD movies and tv shows, straight towards their devices. It runs on the AWS network, providing billions of hours of service. Youtube, another major service runs on Google’s cloud platform, giving users many hours upon hours of entertainment. Many of us use such service without knowing how it works behind the screen.</p>
								<p>Google drive or Microsoft OneDrive for university work or for company work. Where users can store documents and files on the cloud and access them from anywhere using an internet connecting. In the advent of a hard-drive failure a backup from the cloud would be a life-saver. Especially having another avenue aside from physical hard drives to store your data. Cloud computing has made lives more convenient by allowing many opportunities to occur without expensive costs in IT infrastructure, even theoretically make setting up a business easier as you can outsource most of your IT infrastructure to cloud providers for cost effectiveness.</p>
								<p>In the area of education, cloud computing is an interesting field to get into and would most likely be useful for IT students to have expertise on or at the very least know how it operates. With potential discovery of possibilities that may occur with the implementation of cloud technology in different industries.</p>
								<p>However, access to these implementations are only limited by the strength of the internet infrastructure of the users’ country. For gaming there is an obvious limitation on the cloud gaming aspect, being aforementioned internet infrastructure. Not all countries and areas are connected equally. While the direction of cloud gaming is something users would love to realise in Australia, it would not happen for quite a long time.</p>
